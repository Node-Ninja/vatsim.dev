# Connect / OAuth2

VATSIM Connect is our central authentication system. It allows users to log in
to any service using their VATSIM credentials, and allows services to access
information about the user.

## Getting Started

To get started with VATSIM Connect, we first recommend you read the
[API documentation](/api/connect-api) and familiarize yourself with the OAuth2
flow. Once you've done that, you can test against our
[sandbox environment](./sandbox.md).

Once your application is ready for production deployment, you'll need to
register your organization with VATSIM. The application process is available via
the [organization management page](https://auth.vatsim.net/organization).

Once your organization has been approved, you'll be able to create OAuth2
clients for your applications.
