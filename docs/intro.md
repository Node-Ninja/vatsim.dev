# Introduction

Welcome to VATSIM.dev! This is the hub of the VATSIM developer community, where
you can find information about integrating with VATSIM, including documentation,
tutorials, and more.

## Getting Started

If you're new to VATSIM development, we recommend you start with the
[API Overview](./services/apis.md), which will give you a high-level overview of the
various public VATSIM APIs and how they work together.

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to VATSIM.dev, you can find the source code
for this site on [GitHub][source].

Many of our repos are open source, and we welcome contributions from the
community. Public repos are listed under the
[`vatsimnetwork` GitHub organization][github].

## Getting Involved

If you want to get involved with the VATSIM developer community at large, you
can join the _VATSIM Development & Tech_ Discord via the [Community Hub][hub].
This is a great place to ask questions and chat with other developers.

We also have a [GitHub Discussions][forum] forum, where you can ask questions,
share ideas, and more. It's designed for more long-form discussions, and is a
great place to post feature requests or ideas for new projects.
